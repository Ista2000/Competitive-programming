##Problem Statement
You are given two integers **N** and **D**. You have to find N positive integers such that the difference between their product and sum is **D**. The array of these **N** integers should be lexicographically smallest.

For ex:<br>
if N = 4 and D = 1<br>
than these are two of the possible solutions:<br>
A1 = [1, 1, 2, 5]<br>
A2 = [1, 1, 5, 2]<br>
We can see that A1 is lexicographically smaller than A2.<br>

##Input
First line of input contains a single integer T denoting number of testcases.
Next T lines contains two space separated integers N and D.

##Output
For each test case output N space separated integers.

##Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 20<br>
2 ≤ N ≤ 1000<br>
0 ≤ D ≤ 1000<br>

##Sample Input
3<br>
2 1<br>
3 5<br>
4 1<br>

##Sample Output
2 3<br>
1 2 8<br>
1 1 2 5<br>
